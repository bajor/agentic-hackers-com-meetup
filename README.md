## Adding Talks

Edit `index.md` and add a row to the glow table (keep spacing aligned):

```
<div class="line output selectable">   Your Talk Title       │ Speaker Name   │ <a href="https://github.com/username">github.com/username</a></div>
```

## Development

```bash
make install  # Install dependencies
make serve    # Run locally at http://localhost:4000
make dev      # Run with live reload
```
