## What We Do

We're a community of builders exploring autonomous AI agents, LLM-powered tools, and agentic workflows.

- **Build** - Hands-on projects with Claude, GPT, and open-source models
- **Share** - Demo nights, lightning talks, and war stories
- **Connect** - Meet others pushing the boundaries of what agents can do
